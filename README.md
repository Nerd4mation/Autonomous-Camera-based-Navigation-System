# A robust navigation system for autonomous robots


The idea of the project is to produce a robust navigation system for autonomous robots that is capable of generalization across any environment and bridges the reality gap between simulators and the real world.


To demonstrate the idea, we used Carla simulator.
* Modified scripts released by Carla, one to collect training data "Data_Collection_agent,py", and one to drive autonomously using our trained model "Behavioral_Cloning.py".
* Written two notebooks, one used to prepare the data for training "Data_Preparation.ipynb", and another which contains the model we trained "Control_Model.ipynb".
